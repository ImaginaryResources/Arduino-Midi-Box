# Arduino Midi Box
This project was done by using, "The HIDUINO project provides firmwares, documentation, and example code for building a class-compliant USB-MIDI device from an Arduino UNO or Mega 2560" which can be found [here](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/hiduino)

## What was used in this project?
- Hardware
  - Arduino Uno
  - 12 Buttons 
  - 3 Potentiometers
  - 2 Sliding Potentiometers
- Software
  - Atmel Flip
  - Arduino IDE
  - Midi Library
  - 123 Design
- Extras
  - Wires
  - Patience
  - Digital Caliper

## References
This is important because the deivce cannot change it's note values once the code is uploaded and can only be changed via code. All analog input ranges from 0-1023 but midi only has 0-127
  - Exmaple in code: "analogRead(A0)/8; //Divide by 8 to get range of 0-127 for midi"
